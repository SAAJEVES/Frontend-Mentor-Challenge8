## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
This project helped me to perfect my knowledge on using the basic aspect of flex. Most importantly, knowing the way to code and style a web page on viewing it.



### Continued development

My knowlwdge on responsiveness to different viewport sizes was really put to test. Still, more focus and strengthening need to be given to my RWD knowledge. 

### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.
